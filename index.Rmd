### Navigating the Report
This website is an interactive version of the statistical analysis from OIPM's 2017 annual report Annual Report. Analysis is divided into these sections:

3. [Use of Force](#use-of-force)

### Independent Police Monitor Mission and Responsibilities
The Office of the Independent Police Monitor (OIPM) is an independent, civilian police
oversight agency created by the voters in a 2008 charter referendum and opened its doors for
the first time in August of 2009. Its mission is to improve police service to the community,
civilian trust in the NOPD, and officer safety and working conditions. The OIPM has six
broad responsibilities:

1. To ensure that all complaints regarding police misconduct are classified and
investigated or mediated at the appropriate level and that those investigations are
fairly, timely and thoroughly handled; to ensure that discipline is fair, timely,
appropriate and upheld upon appellate scrutiny. To make information about this
review process available to the public.
2. To monitor NOPD investigations into use of force to identify violations of civil
rights, concerns of officer tactics and safety, risks to life, liberty and property, and
adherence to law and policy.
3. To review and analyze aggregate data from complaints, investigations,
community concerns and public policy in crafting recommendations aimed toward
improving the quality of services by the NOPD.
4. To reach out to inform the community about the OIPM, to listen and respond to
broader community concerns, and prepare the community for engagement in
NOPD policy and practice.
5. To mend police/community relationships by fostering effective
police/community partnerships.
6. To collect police commendations, review and monitor police training and
supervision issues and support a healthy and safe working environment for NOPD
employees.

The OIPM is responsible for monitoring the New Orleans Police Department and only the
New Orleans Police Department. Although OIPM works with other criminal justice system
actors, it is not responsible for oversight of any other agency. However, OIPM is mindful of
the impact of these other criminal justice actors upon the operations of NOPD and will
attempt to analyze that impact in future reports. OIPM accomplishes its mission by focusing
on three main activities: complaint and disciplinary system monitoring and review; use of
force monitoring and review; and subject-specific analyses or audits. The IPM’s
recommendations to improve NOPD’s accountability systems originate from these activities.

### **STATISTICAL REVIEW OF NOPD'S USE OF FORCE**

The analysis section of the UOF report is split into three sections:

1. Analysis of details pertaining to the NOPD overall.
2. Analysis of details pertaining to groupings of NOPD officers.
3. Analysis of details pertaining to the individuals subjected to NOPD actions.

### FTN vs UOF
FTN stands for “force tracking number”. It is the designation given to track the entirety
of an interaction between NOPD and one or more individuals wherein force was used.

A single FTN corresponds to one or more UOF. If Officer A and Officer B both use their
hands against Individual C, the result would be one FTN, corresponding to two UOFs
(one for each officer). The same pattern would apply if there were multiple types of
force used or multiple individuals that force was used on.

This report will always clearly label whether FTN or UOF is being used for a particular
analysis but the onus is on the reader to remain vigilant of the distinction.
