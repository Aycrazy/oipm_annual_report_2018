							<li>In 2018, white male officers account for 15 more UOF than all other officers combined, though they make up less than 50% of NOPD. These statistics are nearly identical to 2017â€™s data.</li>
							<li>Black female officers used slightly more force than white female officers. But there are substantially more black female officers than white female officers so their use of force is proportional.</li>
