Within one complaint may be multiple allegations of misconduct.\nAccording to NOPD data, the two most common complaint allegations in 2018, representing roughly 75% of\nall allegations, were: “neglect of duty,” and “professionalism”. Similar to findings analyzed of other\ndepartments, complaints tend to originate from civilian interactions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The dispositions of the complaints filed in 2018 are illustrated in the figure 4: “Most Common Allegations.”\nThis figure illustrates that the most common allegation of “Neglect of Duty” is also the allegation most\nfrequently marked “sustained”. This is consistent with 2017 findings.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Complaint allegations have shifted slightly from 2017. While “neglect of duty” and “professionalism”\nremained the most common allegations, the third most common switched from “instructions from an\nauthoritative source” in 2017 to “adherence to law” in 2018. While there was not a significant percentage\nchange in “adherence to law” allegations between 2017 and 2018, “instructions from an authoritative source”\nallegations decreased by almost sixty (60) allegations, or over 3%.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There was a disciplinary matrix change implemented in March of 2018, as a result, there was a policy shift to\nmore accurately determine the appropriate charge between neglect of duty and instructions from an\nauthoritative source. This resulted in a change in PIB practice resulting in more charges of neglect of duty in\n2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 5: NOPD ALLEGATION FINDINGS</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<AllegationsByFindingPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In 2018, the most common sustained allegation is “neglect of duty” at 52%, mostly unchanged since 2017.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 6: MOST SUSTAINED ALLEGATIONS</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<AllegationsSustainedMostCommonPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>These totals are based on sustained allegations only.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 7: ALLEGATIONS BY SOURCE</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<AllegationsBySourcePlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This classification of each allegation is complimentary to and consistent with the Public vs Rank Initiated\nclassification that each allegation also receives. In 2018, 62% of allegations are classified as the public\ninitiated. Of the 62% of allegations made by the public, approximately 55.5% of those allegations were\nclassified as initiated by a civilian, which means a member of the public was the source of the complaint and\na member of the public submitted a complaint in person to a NOPD employee. Moving forward, the OIPM\nand the NOPD is going to examine this public initiated category (type) to better identify the source of the\ncomplaint. The goal is to better differentiate the data from website complaints, OIPM referrals, and civilian\ncomplaints to confidently determine in the data what is coming from a public source.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n\n\trenderComplaintsOutcomes() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div id=\"complaints-outcomes\">\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 8: COMPLAINT DISPOSITION BY SOURCE</h5>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ComplaintsBySourceDispositionPlot />\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Complaint Analysis</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The largest grouping was of “sustained” complaints at 29.3%. This is almost the identical rate from 2017\n(29.2%).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>While 14.6% of public complaints are sustained (15.6% in 2017), 53.7% of rank complaints are sustained\n(50.7% in 2017), this is more than three times the rate of public complaints. In New Orleans, the public initiates roughly 1.7 times the number of complaints than does rank. In police departments across the US,\npublic complaints often represent the majority of complaints but are the least often sustained.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are different conclusions that can be drawn from this trend. A rank-initiated complaint may and often\ndoes originate from misconduct observed by a supervisor during a public interaction. At this time, the data\ndoes not capture when a rank-initiated complaint originates from an observed act of misconduct during an\ninteraction with a member of the public.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is an argument that the number of sustained rank-initiated complaints is growing because there is an\nincrease of supervisor-based accountability. This means that rank is required under the Federal Consent\nDecree to review officer action within the community, identify misconduct in those interactions, and then\ninitiate discipline against officers. When rank-initiates a complaint, limited investigation is required because\na supervisor observed the misconduct as it occurred or during his or her review the officer’s Body Worn\nCamera.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 9: ALL COMPLAINTS BY OUTCOME</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ComplaintsByDispositionPlot />\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 10: RANK COMPLAINTS BY OUTCOME</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ComplaintsByRankDispositionPlot />\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 11: PUBLIC COMPLAINTS BY OUTCOME</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ComplaintsByPublicDispositionPlot />\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 12: COMPLAINT OUTCOMES BY OFFICER RACE</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ComplaintsByOfficerRaceDispositionPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to NOPD data (please refer to annual-report-2018.nola.ipm.gov), sustained complaints appear to\nbe consistent with officer race demographics.

According to NOPD data, illegal search and seizure was more prevalent than\nhandcuffing and restraints in 2018 at 85.4% of allegations. There were 29 total Fourth Amendment sustained\nallegations in 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Furthermore, NOPD’s data does not make is easy to identify possible 4 th Amendment related allegations.\nMoving forward, NOPD and OIPM will work on this issue together.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The outcomes of Fourth Amendment allegations were relatively similar for both search and seizure and\nhandcuffing and restraint. In both instances, the number of sustained allegations matches that of those\nexonerated. This is a slight deviation from 2017, when exonerations were nearly twice as likely as sustained\nallegations. These findings may indicate a greater accountability mechanism in the department.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t)\n\t}\n\n\trenderAnonymous() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div id=\"complaints-anonymous\">\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 15: ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ComplaintsByAnonymousPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This chart of anonymous complaints captures when the complainant chooses not to give his or her name.

The top three were\n“neglect of duty,” “instructions from an authoritative source,” and “professionalism.” This remains in step\nwith trends from 2017. In 2018, the most common outcomes were letter of reprimand and suspension. In\n2017 the most common outcomes were DI-2 and suspensions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 16: ACTION TAKEN</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<DisciplineByActionTakenAllPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In chart above (Figure 16) are all the outcomes of allegations brought against NOPD employees. Some of\nthese outcomes are disciplinary and others, like mediation and Resigned / Retired Under Investigation (RUI),\nare not disciplinary actions. “No basis for discipline” encompasses allegations that are found to be\nunfounded, exonerated, and not sustained. This means the NOPD conducted an investigation and determined\nthese allegations were not eligible for disciplinary actions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 17: OUTCOMES</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<DisciplineByAllegationPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This chart (Figure 17) captures the outcomes of disciplinary investigations. Some outcomes are disciplinary\nactions and some are not disciplinary actions, like mediation and Resigned / Retired Under Investigation\n(RUI). This chart differs from Figure 16 because Figure 16 includes all outcomes, even those that had no\nbasis for disciplinary action.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 18: DISCIPLINE BY COMPLAINANT GENDER</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<DisciplineByPublicSexPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Males, females, and people of unknown gender were proportionally represented as sources of complaints.\nTheir disciplinary outcomes are similar except for DI-2, letter of reprimand, and suspension which are\ndisproportionately from complainants of unknown gender. Most likely, this is because those outcomes are\nthe result of rank-initiated complaints and if rank-initiated, the NOPD database does not capture the rank’s\ngender.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 19: OUTCOMES BY OFFICER GENDER</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<DisciplineByOfficerSexPlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Outcomes appear to be proportional to the gender breakdown of the NOPD. Males make up 76% of the\npolice department and are proportionally represented in most types of discipline and similarly, female\nemployees are also proportionally represented. There is a negligible number of complaints concerning an\nofficer with an unknown gender.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to the disciplinary matrix, many first offenses are initially resolved with letter reprimand or short\nsuspensions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 20: OUTCOME BY COMPLAINANT RACE</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<DisciplineByPublicRacePlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>50.1% of complainants are categorized as Black / African American. This number is low relative to the\nBlack / African American population of New Orleans and the higher rates of involvement Black / African\nAmerican people experience with law enforcement. Hispanic and Asian complainants are least represented.\nThere are 19 Hispanic complainants (1.9% of all complaints) categorizations but Hispanic people are 5% of\nthe population. 2.9% of people in New Orleans are Asian but there were no complaints categorized as from\nan Asian complainant. One reason for this pattern is that people of unknown race account for 59% of all\ncomplaints.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>That said, disciplinary actions appear to be applied proportionally, regardless of the race of the complainant.\nFurther analysis is needed to determine if any more nuanced race base trends exist in subcategories of the\ndata.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 className=\"text-center\">FIGURE 21: DISCIPLINE BY OFFICER RACE</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<DisciplineByOfficerRacePlot />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Like other police departments analyzed, employee race generally corresponds with department\ndemographics. However, all officers receiving a demotion as a form of discipline were Black / African\nAmerican officers. Black / African American officers or employees are also disproportionately likely to be\ndismissed. At this time, it is difficult to determine the cause of this pattern or if there is a pattern within the\nNOPD data. OIPM would also like to continue to examine this trend with the NOPD in the coming year.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<Page\n\t\t\t\ttitle={\"Complaints - 2018 OIPM Annual Report\"}\n\t\t\t\tnav={this.renderNav()}\n\t\t\t\tbody={\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"mt-5 text-center\">2018 Annual Report</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"mb-5 text-center\">Complaints,\nCommendations &amp;\nDisciplinary Proceedings</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.renderOverTime()}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.renderAllegationsOutcomes()}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.renderComplaintsOutcomes()}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.renderFourth()}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.renderAnonymous()}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.renderDiscipline()}\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n\n}\n\nexport default ComplaintsHighlightsPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
